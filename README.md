# SeanVGO v2 - Online Video Game Organizer
Hello! This is my latest personal project, **SeanVGO v2**! This is an attempt at improving SeanVGO v1 which was launched in 2024.

## Why Did I Build This?
I *could* have just used many of the organizers that are already out there, but I figred why not use my engineering skills and make my own? In 2024 that's what I did. Since launching v1, I have learned so much more about full stack development and web design, so here is v2!
